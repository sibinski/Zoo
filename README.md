# Zoo
In my Zoo live a penguin, a tiger and a dolphin.

At first I focused on inheriting the common properties and functionality of the abstract class. Here I created the two animal classes: Tiger and Dolphin. 

Then I created an interface, Swim, which declared the swimming functionality. And also created the walking functionality in the Walk interface, utilized the Swim interface in the Dolphin class and the Walk interface in the Tiger class.

Then I tried to utilize the menu system provided in the Main class to display the details of the appropriate animal the user requests.

Then I created another new class to represent a Penguin and implementing multiple interfaces so that the Penguin could both walk and swim. 

Then I finally tested the functionality of my app.
